        Built the frontend and backend of an admin panel to increase efficiency for managing 
        ophthalmology surgery consignment to oversee relations between distributors, medical 
        practices, and surgery products from suppliers such as Hoya, Albomed GmbH, and Moria 
        Ophthalmic. Used Ionic, Angular, Loopback, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS to create 
        admin panel. To store and query data used MySQL, JWT for tokens and authorizations and 
        Mocha to create tests.

                <h1>Happy Tweeter</h1>
             <p class="ctitle">Created a social media platform, similar to Twitter for tweens. Before anything can be posted 
                 an AI determines the niceness of the message. Anything negative can not be posted. Built using Ionic and 
                 Angular and implemented Google Firebase to store data.</p>

                <h1>Gitlet</h1>
             <p class="ctitle">Created a version-control system that mimics some of the basic features of Git in Java. The program created a 
                 backup system of collections of files, to save versions of project periodically and the ability to restore to previous 
                 versions. Implemented serializable to save contents of files in bytes.</p>

                <h1>Enigma</h1>
             <p class="ctitle">The Enigma machine was an encryption device used by Germany during WWII. The original device had a set variables such as the sequence of the 
                 alphabet used or the amount of rotors etc. I coded a version in which all of these coould be adjusted. Written in Java.</p>

                <h1>TechTogether Boston Hackathon</h1>
             <p class="ctitle">Created a web app using Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and AppEngine. Its goal was to reduce waste by allowing users to compete 
                 against one another. I worked with Google Login API to store an individual’s unique data and Google Maps API to connect nearby users.</p>

                <h1>Scheme</h1>
             <p class="ctitle">Created a scheme interpreter in Python. Code is inputted in scheme and the program translates the input to
